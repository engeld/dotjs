# ~/.js


## Step 1: Install extension

Chrome:
- OSX (original extension): https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs
- Linux: https://github.com/glenbot/dotjs-ubuntu
- Windows: https://github.com/p3lim/dotjs-win

Firefox:
- All OS: https://github.com/rlr/dotjs-addon

*There are probably also extensions for other browsers, but I only use those two.*

## Step 2: copy scripts

```bash
git clone git@github.com:1ace/dotjs ~/.js
```
